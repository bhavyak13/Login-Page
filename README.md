# Login-Page
1. This is a Login Page made completely by React.js
2. If user enters correct mail nd password, then user will be redirected to Welcome Page else stays on same page and a message flashes saying "Invalid Credentials"
3. Reset Password option is also avialable which will redirect user to /reset page!
4. This assignment/project was part of my interviewing round of internship!
